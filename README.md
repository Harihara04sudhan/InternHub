**Rule-Based Chatbot**


This is a simple Rule-Based Chatbot that responds to user inputs based on predefined rules using basic Python if-else statements. It can handle greetings, farewells, help-related queries, and weather-related inquiries. This chatbot provides a basic introduction to Natural Language Processing (NLP) and conversation flow.

**Features**


Greeting responses: The chatbot will greet users with a friendly response when they say "hello" or "hi".
Farewell responses: The chatbot will say goodbye when users say "bye" or "goodbye".
Help-related queries: If the user asks for help, the bot will respond with an offer to assist.
Weather-related queries: The bot provides a generic response, directing users to check local weather services.
Default response: For any unrecognized input, the chatbot will ask the user to rephrase their query.
Installation
To run this project, make sure you have Python installed. 


***How it Works***


User Input: The chatbot listens for user input via the command line.
Pattern Matching: The chatbot uses if-else statements to match specific keywords in the user's input.
Response Generation: Based on the matched pattern, the chatbot generates an appropriate response.
Loop: The chatbot continues to respond to user inputs until "bye" is entered.
